## Example H Sphere Test ##

# Setup
H sphere of density 8.988E-5 g/cm3 and radius 20.0, 0.5, or 0.01 cm surrounded by a void.
0.1, 0.01, or 0.001 MeV isotropic delta source at the center of the sphere.
Measure flux and current on the surface of the sphere and the track flux in the sphere. Set energy bins for all estimators.

# Trelis geometry commands
To construct the geometry run 'construct_geom.sh' and enter the desired energy.

# Running the simulation if FRENSIE

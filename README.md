# Validation and Verification for FRENSIE

## Neutron Verification Tests

### Bare Hydrogen Sphere
All of these tests consist of a sphere of H1 with a radius of 1.0 cm and an
atom density of 1.0 atom/(b-cm) surrounded by a vacuum. The temperature of the
H1 is changed for each test to verify the free-gas thermal model
implementation. For each test both the current per lethargy and the flux
spectrum is calculated.
